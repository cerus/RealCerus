## Hello there!
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/RealCerus/RealCerus/blob/master/flying%20edina.gif?raw=true" width="302" height="190" />

My name is Maximilian and I mainly work with Java. I'm currently working at [Pypeware](https://github.com/pypeware) as a software developer. Programming is a huge hobby of mine and since November 2020 also my job.

The game Minecraft originally got me into programming in 2017. My programming skills have evolved beyond Minecraft plugins since then and I'm now working on a variety of stuff.

As you may have noticed I'm madly in love with cats. My profile picture shows my beautiful cat Edina (\*2008-â€ 2020). Cats are my favourite animal and I couldn't live without one. I currently have one cat, a ~15 year old Maine Coon named Giovanni.

### My expertise
I started learning Java in 2017 and I would say that I have gathered a bunch of experience with the language and several libraries that were written in it. I'm always using the buildtool Maven with my Java projects. I have also played around with C#, although I don't have nearly as much experience with it as with Java. I would be able to write simple programs in it though. Besides Java and C# I have also tried out Haxe, C++, Rust, JavaScript and Go.\
I have about 2-3 years of experience with SQL and around 1 year of experience with MongoDB.\
I know my way around Git but I'm definitely not a Git pro.

My biggest problem is my lack of practical experience I think.

### Favourite software
I have recently discovered my love for Linux - I'm currently running Arch with KDE Plasma (The Dolphin file manager is really awesome). I switched from Windows to Linux and never looked back. I also really like Jetbrains IDEs. Some say they are bloated, but I quite like the wide array of tools they provide.

### Favourite games
My all time favourite is Minecraft, but I also enjoy trucking and realistic space games, so Euro Truck Simulator 2 and Elite: Dangerous definitely come right after Minecraft. Sometimes I also like to play Scrap Mechanic and CS:GO.
